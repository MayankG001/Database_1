Here are the explanations of some of the commonly used DDL commands:\n",

    "Example: `CREATE TABLE employees (id INT PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR(50),age INT);`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.**DROP**: The DROP command is used to delete an existing database object such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure. For example, the following SQL command drops the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `DROP TABLE employees;`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**ALTER**: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object such as a table, view, or index. For example, the following SQL command adds a new column \"salary\" to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10,2);`\n",
    "\n",
    "4.**TRUNCATE**: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all data from a table, but the table structure remains intact. For example, the following SQL command deletes all data from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `TRUNCATE TABLE employees;`\n",
